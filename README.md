I have created a wireframe design as a plan for the design of the website. I have created four pages for the website, each one having a different purpose. I added a menu that an be accessed by tapping the top left button which pulls up the menu that has different subtitles. Each subtitle is linked to a different page in the website, this meaning that if you pressed on OurTeam subtitle it would redirect you to that page in the website. The first page which is also the main page is the companys description of the service they provide. Each page will include a footer that gives information on how to contact the company and will also have a privacy policy for legal reasons. Each page will also have the company logo at the top for design and to let the user know what company it is they are looking at. the next page is the companys employees, this will include an image of them and what role they have at the business, and an explanation of what their role does in the company. The third page will include the job description that the company is hiring for, this will provide a description of what the business will include and what their job role will be for the comoany, what they will have to do. The page will also include web developing courses links, this is to redirect potential employees to train themselves for the role or if they need any extra help to meet the requirenments. Last page is the forms page, this includes the applications form and application boxes so the user can register online to try and get the role. This page will also have web development links incase the user wants to practise coding. The privacy policy in the footer also has a page redirect which is a seperate page with the companys privacy policy so the user can read the details about what happens with their data.

After getting a review from my friend, I have added some changes he gave me to improve on my design and I also did some changes of my own to create a better looking web page overall. I have decided to change the layout of the first page, reordered it so that the weebpage has more space overall and has a better looking design. I have also changed the second page as from my review it said there was too much going on. I added 2 employees aand some details about them. I decided to use headings in the top right instead of having a drop down menu. I also changed the design of the third website to give the user more details about the job they can sign up for, and I changed the location of the link to the web development courses. On the last page I have also changed the desin and added aa better menu for the user to use inlcuding personal details but also a button that allows you to put in documents from your own pc.

I have also made a flow chart to add to my design plan so I can see how the user would navigate around the website.
