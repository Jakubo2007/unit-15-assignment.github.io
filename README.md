I have created a wireframe design as a plan for the design of the website. I have created four pages for the website, each one having a different purpose. I added a menu that an be accessed by tapping the top left button which pulls up the menu that has different subtitles. Each subtitle is linked to a different page in the website, this meaning that if you pressed on OurTeam subtitle it would redirect you to that page in the website. The first page which is also the main page is the companys description of the service they provide. Each page will include a footer that gives information on how to contact the company and will also have a privacy policy for legal reasons. Each page will also have the company logo at the top for design and to let the user know what company it is they are looking at. the next page is the companys employees, this will include an image of them and what role they have at the business, and an explanation of what their role does in the company. The third page will include the job description that the company is hiring for, this will provide a description of what the business will include and what their job role will be for the comoany, what they will have to do. The page will also include web developing courses links, this is to redirect potential employees to train themselves for the role or if they need any extra help to meet the requirenments. Last page is the forms page, this includes the applications form and application boxes so the user can register online to try and get the role. This page will also have web development links incase the user wants to practise coding. The privacy policy in the footer also has a page redirect which is a seperate page with the companys privacy policy so the user can read the details about what happens with their data.

After getting a review from my friend, I have added some changes he gave me to improve on my design and I also did some changes of my own to create a better looking web page overall. I have decided to change the layout of the first page, reordered it so that the weebpage has more space overall and has a better looking design. I have also changed the second page as from my review it said there was too much going on. I added 2 employees aand some details about them. I decided to use headings in the top right instead of having a drop down menu. I also changed the design of the third website to give the user more details about the job they can sign up for, and I changed the location of the link to the web development courses. On the last page I have also changed the desin and added aa better menu for the user to use inlcuding personal details but also a button that allows you to put in documents from your own pc. I have then combinded both ideas I changed around some layouts to meet the websites requirenments. I will also create a flowchart to create a testing plan of how the user will navigate around the website to see if my layout and wireframe plan will work correctly.

I have also made a flow chart to add to my design plan so I can see how the user would navigate around the website. This is to help me see if it works as intended and to make sure how the user can navigate around it correctly and with no trouble.

After completing my website to meet the user requirenments and using my design plan on how to make the website I will now test the website for functionality, compatibility and usability. I have first started with functionality, I tested if every button works. I pressed every button that is provided on the page and that they all work and redirect you to the correct page when pressed. Meaning that if I was to press applications it would go there no matter if I was on the home page or privacy policy page. I have then tested if the redirect page works to the courses outside of the page, this works perfectly and put them on a page in their browser instead of closing the orignial web page. I have then tested compatibility, I checked if it can run first on different browsers, an example can be google, yahoo and firefox. I tested if the web page can be accessed on those different browsers, they work the same on all browsers which means the page is compatible for different browsers. Then I checked if the site can be used on different devices, this including pc, phone and tablet. I tested if all the images could be seen on the phone the same as the pc, this was successful and they worked the same. Then I tested if the user can press all the buttons on each device and if it worked the same, this was succesful and each device can use the website as intended. I then tested the usability of the website. I tested if the website is efficient, meaning that you can access every page provided from any page  so you dont have to go to the home page to go to the next page even from the privacy policy. I test how easy it is to navigate around it by having some of my friends use it, they used the wesbite as intended and had no trouble getting around it and said all images and text were displayed greatly for all users to see. I tested the website for all 3 of those things to make sure it runs correctly, it works on every device and is made for all users so there isnt a hard tome getting around it.
